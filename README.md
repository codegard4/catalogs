	pymysql 
	tqdm 
	argparse  
	os
	sys 
	math
	numpy 
	pandas
	configparser  

### Universal Commands

|Command|Description|
|:-----:|:----------|
|python filename.py -d |changes the name of the database that is created; should be each catalog in caps with numbers removed (Ex: sao2000-->SAO)|
|python filename.py -f |specifies an alternate location for the catalog's data file|

# SAO2000

### How to Run the sao2000.py File


1. Edit the catalogs.conf file under [SAO2000] to include the server host, port, user and password you wish to have the database created on.
2. Navigate to the command line and run the sao2000.py file by the 'python sao2000.py' command
3. The sao.dat file must be either in the same location as the sao2000.py file or a path to the sao.dat file must be specified

*The default file will create an SAO2000_dev database with all rows of the SAO2000 catalog inserted into the sao1950 and sao2000 files

### Additional SAO Commands

|Command|Description|Default|
|:-----:|:----------|:------|
|python sao2000.py -r |specifies the number of rows to be inserted from the sao2000 catalog| All Rows|

* to run sao ingestion use python sao2000.py -d SAO -f *your local path to the sao.dat file*

# UCAC4


### How to Run the ucac4.py File

1. Edit the catalogs.conf file under [UCAC4] to include the server host, port, user and password you wish to have the database created on.
2. Navigate to the command line and run the ucac4.py file by the 'python ucac4.py' command
3. Ensure that the ucac4 catalog is in the same folder as the ucac4.py file or that an appropriate file path is specified to reach the u4b folder and that the ucac4 zone files are in the u4b folder

### Additional Package Requirements


	struct 
	random 

### Additional UCAC Commands

|Command|Description|Default|
|:-----:|:----------|:------|
|python ucac4.py -n|specifies the number of zone files that should be inserted. For full insertion leave blank|900|
|python ucac4.py -r|specifies whether the files should be randomly or uniformly chosen for insertion. If r==True then files will be randomly chosen up to the specified number of files|False|

* to run ucac ingestion use python ucac4.py -d UCAC -f *your local path to the 900 UCAC zone files*

| python gaia.py -v         | Print errors & star numbers                                                          | False                          |
| python gaia.py -ef        | Create errors flags table?                                                            | False                          |
| python gaia.py -z         | Are the GAIA files unzipped?                                                          | True                           |


* to run gaia ingestion use python gaia_batch.py -d GAIA -f *your local path to the gaia folders* -v True -mr aa,lu
	* -k True will clear the database, do NOT use this after the first run of gaia; only use it for clearing test databases in dev or when you first run the gaia ingestion in a database
	* -v True will print any errors that the file throws when running db ingestion. It will not print duplicate star errors, which are the most common. The SQL DB will throw this error if you try to insert a file that has already been inserted

*Note--gaia_batch is a file that runs batch insertions after each of the 307 directories and is much faster than gaia_single. However gaia_single works well for individual directories to ensure that every line is either being inserted or duplicate stars are being accounted for
